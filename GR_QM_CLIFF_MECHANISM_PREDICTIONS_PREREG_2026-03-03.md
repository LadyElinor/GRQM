# GR_QM Cliff Mechanism Predictions (Pre-Registered) — 2026-03-03

Purpose: satisfy sequencing rule (derivation -> prediction -> diagnostic).

## Candidate mechanisms to test
1. **Method-path amplification hypothesis**
   - Prediction: low-order/stress paths show apparent cliff signatures much earlier/larger than RK-family high-order paths.
   - Observable: large separation in edge diagnostics between Euler-including packs and RK4/DOP853-controlled packs.

2. **Local stiffness transition hypothesis near Ω_m≈0.305**
   - Prediction: error/statistics jump sharply at edge while remaining low in-core, with potential spike-channel activation.
   - Observable: q1 refinement and q2 p95/p99 exhibit order-of-magnitude jump across 0.300 -> 0.305.

3. **Non-penetration hypothesis (core robustness remains isolated)**
   - Prediction: in-core corridor remains stable under same policy; edge instability does not back-propagate into current core envelope metrics.
   - Observable: fresh in-core pass-all remains 20/20 while edge remains blocked.
