# Claim Status Matrix

Created: 2026-02-28  
Updated: 2026-03-08 (edge extension governance addendum logged; core status unchanged)

Purpose: enforce disciplined claim handling using **PROVEN / OPEN / BLOCKED** states.

---

## Status Definitions

- **PROVEN**: supported by pinned citation(s) and/or completed falsification protocol with stable inference.
- **OPEN**: plausible but incomplete; missing either citation hardening, proxy validation, or robustness checks.
- **BLOCKED**: cannot proceed due to missing prerequisites, failed assumptions, or unstable inference.

## Milestone Promotion Decision – 2026-03-02 (Post-Cycle-4-reverted-hardening)

Cycle pair: `cycle-3-rerun-20260302` + `cycle-4-reverted-hardening-20260302`

- All gates: PASS (consecutive, same envelope)
- Null-tests: explicitly passed and logged (`GR_QM_NULL_TEST_LOG.md`)
- Assumptions: A-001/A-002 TESTED and closed under Cycle-3 baseline hardening policy
- High-impact unresolved assumptions: none active

**Verdict: PROMOTE to PROVEN** for the core Q1 proxy claim in the declared envelope.

Promotion scope and caveat:
- Applies to stable in-core envelope only (`Ω_m <= 0.300`, declared α corridor, Cycle-3-equivalent hardening signature).
- Does not apply to edge expansion; `Ω_m >= 0.305` remains blocked pending dedicated mitigation evidence.

  - `notebooks/outputs/grqm_symbolic_ratio_receipt_20260305_214243/symbolic_correction_ratio_summary.json`
- Interpretation: improves derivation/diagnostic traceability; does not mutate claim status, thresholds, or envelope scope.

## C-GRQM-002 Governance Close Decision – 2026-03-05

Decision selected: **Option A (Promote now, in-core only)**.

- Status transition executed: `C-GRQM-002` moved **OPEN → PROVEN (in-core toy envelope)**.
- Basis: two independent same-day RK-family mini-pack receipts + dual-receipt audit PASS against predeclared acceptance criteria.
- Scope caveat: promotion does **not** apply to edge lane; `Ω_m >= 0.305` remains blocked and unchanged.

## Claim Hygiene Checklist

- [x] Does the claim have explicit scope and validity range?
- [x] Are assumptions linked by ID?
- [x] Is there a falsification path (if empirical claim)?
- [x] Is uncertainty/robustness stated?
- [x] Is status set conservatively?

## Escalation Rule

Claim promotion requires:
- OPEN → PROVEN: evidence hardening + no unresolved high-impact assumption conflict.
- BLOCKED → OPEN: blocker explicitly resolved and logged in failure/assumption registers.

## Edge extension governance update (2026-03-08)

- New receipt (full completion):
  - `notebooks/outputs/grqm_edge_companion_inpolicy_adaptive_checkpointed_20260307_132048/edge_companion_aggregate.json`
- Packet outcome:
  - `completed_cases=20/20`, `pass_all_packet_rate=1.0`
  - `max_q1_refinement=1.0475384872639079e-08` (threshold 1e-6)
  - `max_q1_hardened=0.1483037382017592` (threshold 0.18)
  - `max_q2_p95=0.0`, `max_q2_p99=0.0`, `max_replication=0.0`

Governance decision:
- C-WDW-001 core status remains **PROVEN (core envelope)**.
- Edge lane receives **exploratory-open extension** to `O_m <= 0.31` under mandatory constraints:
  1) adaptive refinement,
  2) Radau baseline stiff solver,
  3) overlapping-time interpolation for refinement metrics.
- Physical caveat remains mandatory for any edge-lane interpretation: transient non-perturbative dominance (`correction/classical > 1`) near `O_m=0.3075` means this lane is outside the perturbative semiclassical validity assumed by C-WDW-001.
