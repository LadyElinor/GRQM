# Claim Status Matrix

Created: 2026-02-28  
Updated: 2026-03-02 (governance hold-lift closure; in-core promotion confirmed with edge block caveat)

Purpose: enforce disciplined claim handling using **PROVEN / OPEN / BLOCKED** states.

---

## Status Definitions

- **PROVEN**: supported by pinned citation(s) and/or completed falsification protocol with stable inference.
- **OPEN**: plausible but incomplete; missing either citation hardening, proxy validation, or robustness checks.
- **BLOCKED**: cannot proceed due to missing prerequisites, failed assumptions, or unstable inference.

## Milestone Promotion Decision – 2026-03-02 (Post-Cycle-4-reverted-hardening)

Cycle pair: `cycle-3-rerun-20260302` + `cycle-4-reverted-hardening-20260302`

- All gates: PASS (consecutive, same envelope)
- Null-tests: explicitly passed and logged (`GR_QM_NULL_TEST_LOG.md`)
- Assumptions: A-001/A-002 TESTED and closed under Cycle-3 baseline hardening policy
- High-impact unresolved assumptions: none active

**Verdict: PROMOTE to PROVEN** for the core Q1 proxy claim in the declared envelope.

Promotion scope and caveat:
- Applies to stable in-core envelope only (`Ω_m <= 0.300`, declared α corridor, Cycle-3-equivalent hardening signature).
- Does not apply to edge expansion; `Ω_m >= 0.305` remains blocked pending dedicated mitigation evidence.

Cross-refs:
- `GR_QM_MONTHLY_GATE_REPORT_01.md`
- `GR_QM_CONSECUTIVE_CYCLE_PROMOTION_LEDGER.md`

## Claim Hygiene Checklist

- [x] Does the claim have explicit scope and validity range?
- [x] Are assumptions linked by ID?
- [x] Is there a falsification path (if empirical claim)?
- [x] Is uncertainty/robustness stated?
- [x] Is status set conservatively?

## Escalation Rule

Claim promotion requires:
- OPEN → PROVEN: evidence hardening + no unresolved high-impact assumption conflict.
- BLOCKED → OPEN: blocker explicitly resolved and logged in failure/assumption registers.
